# Instrumental Space Invaders
Instrumental Space Invaders (sound input controls the spaceship)

# Overview
A friend asked me to collaborate in a project for her master's dissertation. Her project _aims to understand and explore the potential and artistic challenges opened by the inclusion of elements of game in the media._
One of the case studies, involved studying the possibility of using sound input to control the game mechanics, and the Space Invaders was chosen as a prototype. This project is the result of that collaboration.
